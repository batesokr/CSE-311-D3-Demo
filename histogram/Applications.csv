John,
I need a mod number from Aileen for the SHRTYPE process. Could you please approve this mod? Here is the details about the process:
Student Type Update Process(SHRTYPE.pc):
The Registrar Office runs this process at the end of each term to roll the SGBSTDN records from the current term to the next term. 
If relocation of a student(from the regionals) processed prior to the end of term run of SHRTYPE (which creates general student record), regionals manually create a general student record for the relocation term and manually enter the relocation student type,  e.g. ""J"". The problem is, when the process runs for a future term it overrides any SGBSTDN records already existing for the term processing. To avoid this the Registrar Office requested us to make a ""Mod"" in the process:
Requested MOD:  
If a general student record already exists for the update term bypass that record and do not update the student type.",Banner Mod/REG,,,arockis,,,,

Banner Mod (C.7.1) - Verification of Student Hours Enrolled,,"9/22/08     Banner 8: cannot be eliminated (emgeac).  This mod addresses a regulatory issue concerning students, hours enrolled, and FIM tax withholding.  Sungard has a new baseline version of this process (PHPSHRS).  We thought we could use it but then found that the baseline version does not take partial terms into account.  For now, we must continue to use this mod (PZRSHRS).  
                        This mod satisfies a regulatory requirement.   Student employees must pay into medicare (FIM) and PERS (RP2) if they are not enrolled at least part time (if they are enrolled at least part time, they do not have to pay into FIM and RP2).  This process is run before each student payroll and automatically updates the student FIM and RP2 deductions according to his/her current enrollment.  Sungard introduced a baseline version of this in Banner 7; however, the baseline version does not incorporate partial terms, which Miami uses, especially in the summer.",Banner Mod/PAY,,,Amy Eldridge,,,,

Without the modification, Flexible Registration uses time ticket information to determine a student’s status to register.   If the student is new – then it assigns a time ticket to them.    This does not work with Miami’s business process of creating and the use of time ticketing.
On the Commons I see that there is one other school that has the same problem.    I am going to work towards getting an RFP to make time ticketing use an option for Flexible Registration.

For now, I need to modify the time ticketing in Flexible Registration. - Suzanne Brack",Banner Mod/LLL,,,Suzanne Brack,,,,

This mod is needed because of the way Miami stores prior sgbstdn records.
Currently  records are rolled each term for students who are actively enrolled.   All previous records remain with the status of “AS” for active.    In order for Flexible Registration to re-admit prior students, it must recognize they have an inactive record for a previous term and it will re-admit them and build a record for a NC student for the term they are registering for through Flex Reg.        This will not occur without a modification to recognize previous records as though they are not active.

The Registrar Office (Carol Jones) said they would like to change their business practice to deactive prior records, however this is a major undertaking and it will be quite some time before they can do so.    
I am requesting a mod until this can be done.",Banner Mod/LLL,,,Suzanne Brack,,,,

To alleviate this confusion, I’d like to mod the page: add logic to display the employee’s current selection (printed or electronic W2) add an email confirmation upon submit add a message on the ESS screen that their selection has been recorded.

Miami departments has been traditionally using Index codes which populates default FOAPAL to process transaction. However SunGard middleware that interface with SciQuest only messages basic index        code info instead of including default FOAPALS. This causes Purchasing, Controller Office and SciQuest to identify and manually fix these values in BuyWay everytime an Index code is created in Banner. Obviously such changes are time consuming and prone to errors.

In past years, we have done a benefit statement (or total compensation statement). We've not done one in several years. They were formerly done on paper. We'd like to build a total compensation module in ESS, presenting an employee's total compensation (salary and benefits) by year. So the employee could select 2009 and see his/her total compensation (salary and benefits) for 2009. This would be viewable to the employee all year long. There is a Banner baseline version of a benefit statement, but it does not meet our needs.                                                                                                                            Maintenance during upgrades will be minimal, about 8 hours.",Banner Mod/HR,,,Amy Eldridge,,,,
Banner Mod (D.7.25) -  HR Premium Pay for Hourly employees - PDPLIFE,,"3/15/10 Approved by Bill Miley                                                                                                                                            The baseline process PDPLIFE is run before every payroll and calculates life insurance values based on the employee’s annual salary (the employee LIF deductions are automatically updated).  During testing, HR discovered that PDPLIFE does not recognize premium pay when calculating life insurance.         As I see it, we have two options.  One, create a process or WF that could be used to update and maintain life insurance values for our premium pay employees.  Two, apply a mod to PDPLIFE so it recognizes premium pay.     4-6 hours to do after each upgrade.  
I believe the best solution for Miami is the latter, apply a mod to PDPLIFE so it recognizes premium pay.  Creating a process to update life insurance values for our premium pay employees just gives HR one more thing to think about, one more item for their task list each payroll.  We’re supposed to be finding ways to make employee processing more efficient and I think changing PDPLIFE is the more efficient option.",Banner Mod/HR,,,Amy Eldridge,,,,

The baseline version of the pay stub (check advice) in Employee Self Service does not include the employee's name.   This can make a printed copy of the pay stub rather worthless if the employee is using it for financial transactions (such as loans).

"Banner Mod (D.8.24) - Remove the advisor plus number and name from baseline Banner web advising transcripts.
Per Hina 10/11/05:
Just turning off visibility flag in the style sheet for a particular procedure (P_Viewtran) which displays student detailed transcript did the trick.",,"10/10/2005 This was accomplished by Scott changing a setting on the style sheet.  I am leaving it in the mod list to make sure the setting gets changed for future versions of Banner. AE
Looks like we will not need a MOD number for this change. Removal of Advisor plus number from baseline web advising transcript looked like a major change  in the beginning. Finally, it turned out a very simple change. Just turning off visibility flag in the style sheet for a particular procedure (P_Viewtran) which displays student detailed transcript did the trick. Thank you Scott for making the change and saving me lot of time.  Hina                                      9/22/2005 Assigned D number (Phyllis)

When employee's access the LR system, the default month displayed is the current month, but the employee will be submitting leave for the previous month.
