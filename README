		CSE 311 D3 Demo

What is it?
------------

This project was created to demonstrate the power of using D3 for analyzing 
and visualizing data. The data analyzed was the Current Applications CSV 
file provided by Miami Universities' EA architects. The website provides 
a histogram of a subset of columns along with a sidebar for column selection. 
The subset of columns were chosen by manually analyzing the CSV file and 
selecting which columns would be good candidates for histograms. Certain 
columns, such as the name or the description, were omitted. 


How does it work?
-----------------
The project is a combination of various JavaScript libraries. JQuery is 
used to send an HTTP request to the server so the CSV file can be available 
locally. It is also used for querying DOM elements as well as setting up
event listeners. Papa Parse is used for parsing the CSV file line-by-line,
allowing the sequential buildup of multiple histograms. Bootstrap is used
for the creation of the header as well as the sidebar for a more visually
appealing experience on viewing the histograms. D3 is used to construct
the bar graphs of the histograms.
